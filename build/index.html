    <h1>The Internet of Wind Manifesto</h1>
    
    <p>We are a global movement united by the belief that the wind sector is driving and is crucial for the whole energy industry. We are convinced that actually a false competition dilemma around data sharing is blocking the natural evolution of the entire industry.</p>

    <img src="img/illustration.jpg" />

    <p>We believe that:</p>

    <ul>
      <li class="odd first">In the near future wind turbines will be smart, connected and able to talk the same language as people</li>
      <li class="even">Sharing is better than locking: what is a competitive asset for the individual is a benefit for the whole wind energy industry</li>
      <li class="odd">There are no super-heroes. Community-generated knowledge is the key to create competitive industry assets</li>
      <li class="even last">Nobody shares their data and nobody knows why. This is what we call a "confidentiality bubble"</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We want to live in a world where everybody should be free to give their own contribution.</p>

    <p>In order to do this, we need to:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Burst the wind data confidentiality bubble</li>
      <li>build an open standard for wind turbine data, designed around sharing</li>
    </ul>

        The confidentiality bubble

      <div class="desc">
        <p>A bubble is a layer between you and the outside world distorting your vision. It can become so large that it shuts out your sight. At the same time it is so easy to dissolve. In wind energy there is a huge misunderstanding about data sharing.</p>

        <p>We do not want to reinvent the wheel. We just want to publicly discuss and build shared foundations for this new world. This is only possible by developing open souce platforms and open standards as an alternative to the myriad of proprietary hardware and software platforms developed by all the big players</p>

    <div class="desc">
      <p>There are multiple examples where sharing proprietary data paid itself. The most famous one is the Goldcorp Inc. This big mining corporation shared it's confidential data and created a crowd-sourced challenge to find new mining sites</p>
