    <h2>Our beliefs</h2>

    <ul>
      <li class="odd first">In the near future wind turbines will be smart, connected and able to talk the same language as people</li>
      <li class="even">Sharing is better than locking: what is a competitive asset for the individual is a benefit for the whole wind energy industry</li>
      <li class="odd">There are no super-heroes. Community-generated knowledge is the key to create competitive industry assets</li>
      <li class="even last">Nobody shares their data and nobody knows why. This is what we call a "confidentiality bubble"</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We want to live in a world where everybody should be free to give their own contribution.</p>

    <p>In order to do this, we need to:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Burst the wind data confidentiality bubble</li>
      <li>build an open standard for wind turbine data, designed around sharing</li>
    </ul>
